# Loss of Empathy in Medicine

Key Concept
Most research identifies a decline in empathy, particularly during the intense clinical training years (e.g., medical school, residency), with factors like burnout, high workload, lack of role models, and the "hidden curriculum" being major contributors.

1. Research from the Netherlands
Dutch studies often focus on the medical school environment and measurement of empathy.

Neumann M, Edelhäuser F, Tauschel D, et al. Empathy decline and its reasons: a systematic review of studies with medical students and residents. Acad Med. 2011. While not exclusively Dutch, this seminal systematic review is frequently cited in Dutch and European research. It conclusively establishes the phenomenon of empathy decline.

Batt-Rawden SA, Chisolm MS, Anton B, Flickinger TE. Teaching empathy to medical students: an updated, systematic review. Acad Med. 2013. Another major review used as a foundation in Dutch medical education research.

Holst M, Härter M, Schäfert R. [Empathy in medical students--assessment and relationship to clinical competence]. Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 2014. (German study, but representative of EU research cited in the Benelux context).

Dutch researchers often use specific tools like the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE). Searching for ("Jefferson Scale of Empathy" AND Netherlands) on PubMed yields studies assessing empathy levels in Dutch student cohorts.

2. Research from the European Union (EU)
EU research often explores cultural factors, the Bologna Process in education, and comparisons across countries.

Hemmerdinger JM, Stoddart SD, Lilford RJ. A systematic review of tests of empathy in medicine. BMC Med Educ. 2007. A foundational review for measurement in the EU context.

Hojat M, Louis DZ, Markham FW, Wender R, Rabinowitz C, Gonnella JS. Physicians' empathy and clinical outcomes for diabetic patients. Acad Med. 2011. An Italian-US collaboration demonstrating the critical link between physician empathy and improved patient outcomes, which is a central argument for why its decline is a serious issue.

Kataoka HU, Koide N, Ochi K, Hojat M, Gonnella JS. Measurement of empathy among Japanese medical students: psychometrics and score differences by gender and level of medical education. Acad Med. 2009. Highlights that the issue is global, not Western-specific.

Wilkinson H, Whittington R, Perry L, Eames C. Examining the relationship between burnout and empathy in healthcare professionals: A systematic review. Burn Res. 2017. A UK review strongly linking burnout (a huge problem in EU healthcare systems) directly to decreased empathy.

3. Research from the USA
The USA has produced a vast amount of literature on this topic, often linking it to medical student and resident wellbeing, burnout, and the clinical learning environment.

Hojat M, Vergare MJ, Maxwell K, et al. The devil is in the third year: a longitudinal study of erosion of empathy in medical school. Acad Med. 2009. This is one of the most cited US papers. It precisely identifies the critical clinical transition period (third year) where empathy decline is most pronounced.

Shanafelt TD, West C, Zhao X, et al. Relationship between increased personal well-being and enhanced empathy among internal medicine residents. J Gen Intern Med. 2005. Links resident well-being directly to empathy levels.

PubMed Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15693925/

Brazeau CM, Schroeder R, Rovi S, Boyd L. Relationships between medical student burnout, empathy, and professionalism climate. Acad Med. 2010. Examines how the institutional "climate" affects both burnout and empathy.

PubMed Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21045670/

Dyrbye LN, Massie FS Jr, Eacker A, et al. Relationship between burnout and professional conduct and attitudes among US medical students. JAMA. 2010. A large-scale study showing burnout is associated with unprofessional behavior and reduced empathy.

How to Find More (Recommended PubMed Search Terms)
You can effectively search PubMed yourself using these terms:

("empathy decline" OR "empathy erosion") AND ("medical students" OR residents)

("compassion fatigue" OR "burnout") AND physicians AND empathy

("Jefferson Scale of Empathy" OR "JSPE") AND (medical education)

("hidden curriculum" AND empathy AND medical)

Add geographic terms: e.g., AND (Netherlands OR Europe OR United States)

Summary
The literature consistently shows that losing empathy is a significant, transnational issue in medicine, primarily catalyzed by the pressures of clinical training and practice. It is not an innate personal failing but rather a systemic issue related to training environments, workload, and professional socialization. Research from the USA is most voluminous, while Dutch and EU studies often integrate this evidence into local contexts and educational reforms.

Important Note: While decline is common, research also focuses on interventions (e.g., mindfulness, narrative medicine, reflective practice) that can mitigate this erosion, emphasizing that the trend is not inevitable.
